<h1>Dating App</h1>

I am creating a Dating Suggestion App using the Spring Boot framework with a MySQL database and a frontend UI. The application allows users to register by providing their name, age, gender, and interests, which are then stored in the database along with a unique user ID.

When users open the Date App, they are first directed to the registration page, where they must fill in the required details. After registration, the app matches users based on their preferences and displays highly preferred matches. The matching algorithm prioritizes compatibility, ensuring that users see the most relevant suggestions based on their interests and other factors.
